# Intro-to-Java-Examples
So we got some really fancy examples:
- Timer Example --> demonstrates Timers and EventListeners and ActionEvents and all that good stuff, good for making fancy loops.
- Simple Grid   --> No idea what it does, probably some sort of Grid? Maybe it uses Graphics? Your guess is as good as mine.
- Simple Grid but it changes color --> Just like the last one but it changes color? I like the sound of that.
